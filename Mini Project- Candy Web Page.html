  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reese's Cups:</td>

  <tr>

    <td>Long Lasting Hard Candy</td> 
    <td>Very sweet taste of Diffrent Fruits</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>KitKats are also a big favorite among the majoraty of people. I like them as anny other candy but these are the reasons that they are so common:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>They are fun to have in your mouth because of the crunchy texture.</li>
  <li>The chocolate can melt in your mouth amplifying the good taste</li>
  <li>Finaly, the two combined make something that is delicious and comfortable in your mout at the same time!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you may be thinking, how can you only have two favorites? There are so many delicious candies that are have to be on the greatest list. So, here is your GREATEST LIST of candy. The list is orderd acording to my preferences. The folowing is just aproved by me. Behold, THE GREATES LIST OF CANDY:</p>
