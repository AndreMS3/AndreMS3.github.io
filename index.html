<h1 style="text-align:center;">Top Five Gaming Computer Brands</h1>
<h3>1) <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/">Asus</a></h3>
<p>Asus is the #1 brand for gaming computers because they apply all of the greatest tech to acheive the best specifications possible for their computers. But this is not sufficient for being the #1 brand in gaming computers - Asus also applies their own tech that they specificaly created to make your gaming experience better. They always exeed expectations when it comes to gaming superiority. You will have no worries for problems with those computers.</p>
<p>Asus's flaw, Asus has heavy computers. They integrate the greates tech and their own extra things to make the perfect computer...that is a bit heavier then the standerd.</p>
<h3>2) <a href="https://us.msi.com/index.php">MSI</a></h3>
<p>MSI is kind of like Asus, they apply the best tech possible to acheive the greatest. They also apply their own. The real difference is that Asus's extras are better that MSI's. But, comming back at that MSI has less heavy and smaller computers. This is not delivering the ultimate experienve that Asus delivers but it is more practical and dose have some useful features.</p>
<p>MSI's flaw, they don't have a lot of technology to prevent the things that usually happen when the computer is not powerful enough for running a certain game. Things like lag, tearing...</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/">Razer Blade</a></h3>
<p>Razer Blade tries to keep their computers as small and light as possible. They are made to be portable gaming computers. They deliver a lot of power through the latest tech but barely annything of their own. Just some peices of software to be able to do more than gaming with things pre-installed. But for the power the computers deliver, they are extremely portable and easy to transport.</p>
<p>Razer Blade's flaw, Their computers can overheat fairly fast due to the lack of cooling capabilites. Enhaced cooling was taken away for portability but a price must be payed.</p>
<h3>4) <a href="http://www.alienware.com/">Alienware</a></h3>
<p>Alienware is kind of like the gaming computers of Dell. They aren't super duper amazingly good but they do deliver a lot of power.</p>
